# GOVERNANCE REPORT - Berea Health Notes

## 1. Project Purpose
Berea Health Notes is a simple, fast web app built in Google AI Studio for nurses at Berea Clinics, Lesotho.
The nurse types quick, messy notes. The app turns them into a clear, structured SOAP note (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan).
It is for nurse support and documentation, not to replace clinical judgement.

## 2. Privacy Protection - No Patient Identification
- Nurses must NOT type full patient names, ID numbers, or dates of birth into the app.
- Use anonymous Patient ID only, e.g. BEREA-045, or initials if needed.
- If a name is typed by mistake, it must be removed / replaced with [REDACTED] before copying.
- The final SOAP note is copied by the nurse to the official clinic record. No patient data is stored in the app.
- No data is shared with third parties.
- Clear the input after copying to maintain clinic privacy.

## 3. Clinical Safety Guardrails
- The app only formats notes into SOAP structure. It does NOT diagnose or prescribe for a specific patient.
- The app must use plain, simple English to avoid confusion.
- Urgent symptoms must be highlighted in RED for follow-up.
- The nurse must review and correct the SOAP note before using it.
- All clinical decisions remain with the nurse / doctor.
- If information is missing, the app must write "Unknown" - it must NOT invent labs, doses, or dates.

## 4. Design for Low-Resource Clinics
- Mobile-first: works well on a phone for a busy clinic.
- Works with low internet: simple, fast, no heavy images.
- Copy button: nurse can copy the final note quickly to the official record.
- Simple language for busy nurses.

## 5. Human Oversight
- A qualified nurse reviews every SOAP note before it is used.
- The app does not replace a nurse or doctor.
- Urgent / red-flagged notes must be escalated to senior nurse / doctor immediately.

## 6. Fairness and Accuracy
- Information is based only on what the nurse typed, not on assumptions.
- No bias based on gender, age, HIV status, or background. All patients treated with dignity.
- SOAP format is the standard format clinics use, so notes stay consistent.

## 7. Limitations
- This is a student / learning support tool, not a certified medical device.
- It cannot access real patient records.
- It should not be used alone for clinical decisions in Berea Clinics.

## 8. Version Control and Accountability
- Builder prompt, README, and this report are version-controlled on GitHub.
- Changes are saved with date and reason.
- Previous working version can be restored if a new version breaks safety.
